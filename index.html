<h1>About </h1>

<p>Originally from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mena-ark.com/" title="Mena" class="">Mena, Arkansas</a>, I&#8217;ve lived in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.conwayonline.com/" title="Conway" class="">Conway</a>&nbsp;since 1998. I&#8217;m married to my high school sweetheart, Jamie Steele. We have 2 children, Rachel and Levi.</p>
<p>I graduated from&nbsp;<a href="http://acorn.dmsc.k12.ar.us/" title="Acorn" class="">Acorn High School</a>&nbsp;in 1996. In 2000, I graduated from the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.uca.edu/" title="UCA" class="">University of Central Arkansas</a>&nbsp;with a BBA in Information Systems. Since 2005, I&#8217;ve worked in Downtown Little Rock for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.egov.com/" title="NIC" class="">NIC</a>&nbsp;developing&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23egov" title="" class="">eGov</a>&nbsp;solutions for the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.arkansas.gov/" title="" class="">State of Arkansas</a>.</p>

<p>When I&#8217;m not spending time with my family or sitting in front of my computer, I enjoy&nbsp;<a href="/photography" title="My Photos" class="">photographing</a>&nbsp;the world around me with my Nikon.</p>
