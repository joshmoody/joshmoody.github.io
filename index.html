<h1>About </h1>

<p>Originally from <a href="http://www.mena-ark.com/" title="Mena">Mena, Arkansas</a>, I've lived in <a href="http://www.conwayonline.com/" title="Conway">Conway</a> since 1998. I'm married to my high school sweetheart, Jamie Steele. We have 2 children, Rachel and Levi.</p>
<p>I graduated from <a href="http://acorn.dmsc.k12.ar.us/" title="Acorn">Acorn High School</a> in 1996 and received my BBA in Information Systems from the <a href="http://www.uca.edu/" title="UCA">University of Central Arkansas</a> in 2000.</p>

<p>Since 2005, I've worked in Downtown Little Rock for <a href="http://www.egov.com/" title="NIC">NIC</a> developing <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23egov" title="">eGov</a> solutions for the <a href="http://www.arkansas.gov/" title="">State of Arkansas</a>.</p>

<p>When I'm not spending time with my family or sitting in front of my computer, I enjoy <a href="/photography" title="My Photos">photographing</a> the world around me with my Nikon.</p>
